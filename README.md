# Functional and Logic Programming in Haskell

This repository contains two homework assignments (`hw1.hs` and `hw2.hs`) related to functional and logic programming in Haskell. Each assignment includes a number of tasks implemented as Haskell functions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have a Haskell compiler installed (such as GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

## Assignments

### `hw1.hs`

This Haskell script contains several functions showcasing basic functional programming concepts. These functions include:

- `shiftString`: Shifts the characters in a string.
- `isShiftedForEquLessThanIterationTimes` and `isShifted`: Checks if one string is a shifted version of another.
- `stupidListOp`: Performs an operation on a list of integers.
- `getNextLine` and `pascalLine`: Generates a line of Pascal's Triangle.
- `toList`, `padWithZero`, `toDigits`, `doubleEveryOther`, `sumDigits`, `validate`: Implements various operations related to the validation of credit card numbers.

### `hw2.hs`

This Haskell script continues to explore functional programming concepts with a different set of functions. These include:

- `makeDistinctInt` and `makeDistinctString`: Removes duplicate items from a list.
- `multiplyLists`: Multiplies items in a list.
- `listSquares` and `roundSquare`: Deals with square numbers.
- `twoSqaures`: Finds two squares that sum up to a given prime number.
- `slowSort`: Sorts a list of integers.

## Running the Scripts

To run the Haskell scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Haskell script you want to run.
3. Compile the script using the GHC compiler with the command `ghc --make script_name.hs` (replace `script_name.hs` with the name of the script).
4. Run the compiled file using the command `./script_name` (replace `script_name` with the name of the script without the `.hs` extension).
